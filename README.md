# This repository contains the code and methods written in Python for better stellar-originated signal detection from JWST MIRI images. 

The first installment is on simulated image. The second installment will involve actual JWST MIRI image data.

As of January 29, 2024, the second installment did involve real JWST MIRI data! You can access the code from "realdata" folder. The details and other related documentation and stuff will be provided asap.
